# explore-bikeshare-us-data
 Project description In this project, I have performed an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. I have compared the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington DC. I have also investigated if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users. I have used Python(Pandas) to explore data and perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. I have also used a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help visualize the data.
